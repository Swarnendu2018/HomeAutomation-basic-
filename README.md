# HomeAutomation-basic-
This is a basic home automation project
In this section we can easily automate our home appliances using any tv remote.
Our main objective is to make our life smooth & healthy.

Hardware Requirment:
1. Arduino UNO
2. Tshop 1738 sensor(IR receiver)
3. Relay Module
4. Bulb(or any AC appliance)
5. Connecting Wire

Working Principal:

in this section our sensor tshop 1738 which we basically called ir receiver receive signal from ir sender that is our remote.Then our 
microcontroller receive this signal & make it a equivalent hex code & then again send to to the appliances through wire.
